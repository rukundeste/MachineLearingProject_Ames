Hello,
Thank you for taking a look at my machine learning project on Ames housing data prediction. The Ames Housing Dataset consists of the housing sale records between 2006-2010. It contains various features and attributes of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, USA. 

The dataset is widely used in the machine learning community for tasks such as regression modeling, feature engineering, and predictive analytics related to housing prices. It serves as a valuable resource for developing and testing machine learning algorithms and techniques in the real estate domain.

The dataset consists of 2580 rows and 81 columns. : The features include both numerical and categorical variables, covering a wide range of aspects such as lot size, number of rooms, location, construction, and more.

The goal of this project is to create the most accurate machine learning model with the best scores. A modelâ€™s score is a statistical metric which gives an indication of its quality or predictive power based on how well it fits the data or makes predictions. 

Approach: 
Data preparation: Preprocessing data through missing values Imputation and feature engineering . Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Select and train a model: Develop a predictive model by testing out various models such as simple linear regression, multiple linear regression and different tree-based models.
Optimize the model: Tune hyperparameters   through grid searching 
Identify most important features on house sale prices through features selection.
Select the best model based on cross validation score.

For an easy visualization of my project, I put together a google slides presentation. View it here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17ylqWqy5LU5A5rxQHbmiaxig7eebLOaa/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108885081356220755570&rtpof=true&sd=true
