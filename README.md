Hello,
Thank you for taking a look at my machine learning project on Ames housing data prediction. The Ames Housing Dataset consists of the housing sale records between 2006-2010. It contains various features and attributes of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, USA. 
The dataset is widely used in the machine learning community for tasks such as regression modeling, feature engineering, and predictive analytics related to housing prices. It serves as a valuable resource for developing and testing machine learning algorithms and techniques in the real estate domain.
The dataset consists of 2580 rows and 81 columns. : The features include both numerical and categorical variables, covering a wide range of aspects such as lot size, number of rooms, location, construction, and more.
The goal of this project is to create the most accurate machine learning model with the best scores. A modelâ€™s score is a statistical metric which gives an indication of its quality or predictive power based on how well it fits the data or makes predictions.
